How do you remove outliers from Z-score? Take your data point, subtract the mean from the data point, and then divide by your standard deviation. That gives you your Z-score. You can use Z-Score to determine outliers. When you determine outliers it depends on you to delete them or use log, winsorize, and similar methods.
